# Cumulocity Indoor Air Quality Widget

The Indoor Air Quality Widget displays the current value of the measured indoor air quality and the corresponding condition. In addition, it provides a recommendation on how the indoor air quality can be improved in case it is necessary. The widget expects a measurement in the range between 0 and 500.

The supported levels are:
* Excellent - 0-50
* Good - 51-100
* Lightly Polluted - 101-150
* Moderately Polluted - 151-200
* Heavily Polluted - 201-250
